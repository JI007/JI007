👋 Hi, I’m Jamal Ismail

I’m an Cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in IT support, networking, and system troubleshooting. 
My career has been built on helping end users solve technical challenges—whether through hardware and software troubleshooting, maintenance, or application support. 

I’m passionate about making technology work efficiently and securely for everyone.

I also have hands-on experience in computer networking, with a solid understanding of network design, protocols, and security best practices. I've completed several Cisco Packet Tracer projects that simulate real-world networking environments to reinforce my learning. 

Some of my Packet Tracer projects include:

- Basic router and switch configuration

- VLAN setup and inter-VLAN routing

- Static and dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF)

- DHCP and DNS server configuration in a simulated network

- Network security implementation with ACLs and port security

- Wireless LAN configuration with authentication

- Troubleshooting end-to-end connectivity issues

On this GitHub, you'll find some of my learning projects, labs, and tools that I’ve explored in information technology. I’m always learning and growing in the IT and cybersecurity fields, so stay tuned for more projects and notes on what I'm currently working on.
